# WebSocketTransport

A WranggleRpc transport, sending and receiving messages over [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket). 


## Setup 

If you are using the full [@wranggle/rpc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wranggle/rpc) package, the WebSocketTransport is already
 bundled within. You can import/require it with: 

```javascript
import { WranggleRpc, WebSocketTransport } from '@wranggle/rpc';
// or
const { WranggleRpc, WebSocketTransport } = require('@wranggle/rpc');
```

#### Unbundled Alternative
If you prefer using just the packages you need, the unbundled es6 is also available on NPM:

```bash
yarn add @wranggle/rpc-core @wranggle/rpc-websocket-transport
# or
npm install @wranggle/rpc-core @wranggle/rpc-websocket-transport 
```

Unbundled import:
```javascript
import WranggleRpc from '@wranggle/rpc-core';
import WebSocketTransport from '@wranggle/rpc-websocket-transport';
```

### Construction

When creating your WranggleRpc endpoint, you can use the `websocket` shortcut to also construct this transport,
eg `new WranggleRpc({ websocket: myWebsocketOpts })`. See endpoint-specific instructions below. 
      

## Client-side endpoint

On the client-side (browser page or non-server process) you need to provide either a URL to the server or an existing socket.

Example:
```javascript
const transport = new WebSocketTransport({
  websocketUrl: 'ws://myWebsocketServer.example'
});
const rpc = new WranggleRpc({ transport });
```

#### Client-side option: `websocketUrl`
This option creates a new WebSocket connection using the [ReconnectingWebSocket](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reconnecting-websocket)
 library. 
 You can provide the URL as a string, a Promise resolving to one, or a function that returns one. 

 If you want to set options on ReconnectingWebSocket or create a socket some other way, use the `clientSocket` option.

#### Client-side option: `clientSocket`
This option lets you supply a socket rather have the transport create one for you. You can provide a browser-standard socket, your own ReconnectingWebSocket instance, or something else that is API compatible to either.
The option accepts a socket, a Promise of one, or a function returning one.

#### Client-side static method: `buildReconnectingWebSocket`

You can create your own ReconnectingWebSocket instance with this static factory. 
`WebSocketTransport.buildReconnectingWebSocket(...args: any[]) => ReconnectingWebSocket`. It passes its arguments to the ReconnectingWebSocket constructor. Eg:
```javascript
const transport = new WebSocketTransport({ 
  clientSocket: WebSocketTransport.buildReconnectingWebSocket(someUrl, [], { maxRetries: 6 }) 
});
```

## Server-side endpoint

As connections are made, your WebSocket server will likely offer access to the socket object in a listener. You'll need that to set up your server-side WranggleRpc endpoint. For example:

```
wss.on('connection', (socket, request) => {
  if (isValidUser(request)) {
    const transport = new WebSocketTransport({ serverSocket: socket });
    const rpc = new WranggleRpc({ transport });
    setupMyRpcRequestHandlers(rpc);
  }
}
```

The `wss` in the above example is for a library like [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) but other WebSocket servers should offer something similar.

The `serverSocket` attrib is required. 


## Additional methods

When it comes to WebSockets, you'll often want to hook into its events. Should you need to, this transport provides access to the event handlers and to the underlying socket. 

* **addEventListener** and **removeEventListener**. Forwards to the underlying socket. Params: `(eventType: 'open' | 'close' | 'message' | 'error', listener: EventListener)`

* **`getPromisedWebSocket() => Promise<WebSocket>`** returns the underlying socket (once resolved should you have deferred its construction)
